## üß™ How to Use

1. **Open the Gradio Web Interface.**  
2. **Record your voice** using the microphone input.  
3. **Upload a patient image** (e.g., skin photo).  
4. **Submit** to receive:
   - Transcribed speech.
   - Doctor‚Äôs medical response.
   - Audio playback of the response.
  
### üîç Example Interaction

#### Input

- **Voice**: "I have some redness on my cheek. Can you tell me what it is?"
- **Image**: Upload a clear photo of your face.
